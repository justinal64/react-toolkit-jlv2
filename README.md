# react-toolkit-jlv2

Have you ever found yourself copy and pasting the same components between projects? Well this is my answer to that problem. I created an npm package that contains all the components I have created.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

Would you like to play with the components I have created?

This will install the package

```
npm install --save--dev react-toolkit-jlv2
```

This will launch storybook, so you can view the components

```
npm run storybook
```
